                    <h2 class="post-header">Why I chose the Frontend Career Path as my go-to choice for learning</h2>
                    <p class="post-description">The Frontend Career Path by Scrimba is my go-to course due to the high quality content, 
                        as well as the excellent resources made available by Scrimba to help you gain the right experience as well as 
                        the correct level of knowledge needed to make the switch into a developer career path. The many different modules
                        go in depth, with top-class teachers who are knowledgable and are able to get information across in a simple yet 
                        effective manner.
                        <br/>
                        It is the best way to go if you are interested in taking the step into the world of development.

                    <h2 class="post-header">How I found Scrimba</h2>
                    <p class="post-description">I found scrimba after searching for a reliable school to learn basic web development skills.
                        After learning HTML and CSS through freeCodeCamp, I wanted to further my skills by going into Frontend development. 
                        Scrimba offered a free course for Javascript, which was in depth and I found that I appreciated the methods used to teach
                        as well as the teachers pure commitment to their craft. It was the only way forward after that.
